version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I\u2019ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-diff\"><pre><span class=\"pl-md\"><span class=\"pl-md\">-</span>  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-mi1\"><span class=\"pl-mi1\">+</span>  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"</span></pre></div>\n<p>In the above example you can see an in-range update. <code>1.7.0</code> is included in the old <code>^1.6.0</code> range, because of the <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges\" rel=\"nofollow\">caret <code>^</code> character </a>.<br>\nWhen there is a failure reported for the update I\u2019ll create a pull request so you know about the problem immediately. When it reports success I\u2019ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.</p>\n<p>This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you\u2019ll get to know of potential problems immediately <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"sparkles\" fallback-src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png\">\u2728</g-emoji></p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-diff\"><pre><span class=\"pl-md\"><span class=\"pl-md\">-</span>  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-mi1\"><span class=\"pl-mi1\">+</span>  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"</span></pre></div>\n<p>In this example the new version <code>4.0.0</code> is not included in the old <code>^3.0.0</code> range.<br>\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request right away.</p>\n<p>Now <strong>you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand</strong> \u2013 I\u2019ll just let you know automatically.<br>\nAnd the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update.
