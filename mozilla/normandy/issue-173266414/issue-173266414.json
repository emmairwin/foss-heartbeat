{"body_text": "Hello lovely humans,\nwelcome to automated dependency management with Greenkeeper.\nTo take full advantage of this service I recommend to start out with up-to-date dependencies.\nI just updated all the dependencies in the package.json file in one go.\nPlease look into these changes and make sure your project still works with them applied.\nIf you can\u2019t update everything right now that\u2019s fine as well.\nWe\u2019ll get there over time.\nNow that you told me to monitor this project I\u2019ll create a branch for every dependency update, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version.

When it reports success I\u2019ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.\nThis way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you\u2019ll get to know of potential problems immediately \u2728\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\nIn this example the new version 4.0.0 is not included in the old ^3.0.0 range.\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request right away.\nNow you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand \u2013 I\u2019ll just let you know automatically.\nAnd the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update.
