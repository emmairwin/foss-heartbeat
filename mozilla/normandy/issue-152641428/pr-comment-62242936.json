Not all\n+Django settings are available for configuration.\n+\n+``DATABASE_URL``\n+    A `database url`_, including any username and password, if needed.\n+    Default ``postgres://postgres@localhost/normandy``.\n+``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``\n+    A string used to as a seed for security features. This should be the same\n+    on all instances that share a database, and should be kept secret. It\n+    should be a long, random string. Required, no default.\n+``DJANGO_DEBUG``\n+    ``true`` or ``false``. Default ``false``. Enables Django's debug mode. This\n+    should never be enabled on permanent servers.
