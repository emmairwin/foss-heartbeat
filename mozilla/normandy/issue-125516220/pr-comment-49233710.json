The end goal of SHIELD\n+is to allow Firefox to perform a variety of actions to aid the user and gather\n+feedback to guide us in developer a better browser for them. To do this, we need\n+a way to instruct Firefox to perform certain actions without having to download\n+an update or wait for a new release.\n+\n+To accomplish this goal, the SHIELD system consists of:\n+\n+Normandy\n+   Service that acts as the source of actions that we wish to perform, and\n+   determines which users receive which recipes.\n+Self-Repair System Addon\n+   Ships with Firefox and handles fetching recipes and action implementations\n+   from Normandy and executing them within Firefox.\n+\n+.. note:: Normandy provides both the names of actions and, separately,\n+   implmentations for them to be used in the self-repair system addon. Other\n+   Firefox features may also query Normandy and implement the actions however\n+   they wish, and are not required to use the implementations that Normandy\n+   provides.\n+\n+Normandy / Self-Repair Protocol\n+-------------------------------\n+The following section describes the protocol used to communicate between\n+Normandy and the Self-Repair system addon. The domain ``shield.mozilla.org``\n+is used as a stand-in domain; the actual domain Normandy is hosted at may be\n+different.\n+\n+.. warning:: The following documentation is still in flux and does not describe\n+   a live system yet. Expect the protocol to change.\n+\n+Retrieving Recipes\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+The Self-Repair addon retrieves a list of recipes by making an HTTP POST request\n+to the URL::\n+\n+   https://shield.mozilla.org/api/v1/fetch_bundle\n+\n+The request should contain a JSON object of the form:\n+\n+.. code-block:: json\n+\n+   {\n+      \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n+      \"firefox_version\": \"42.0.1\"\n+   }\n+\n+The API will respond with a JSON object:\n+\n+.. code-block:: json\n+\n+   {\n+      \"recipes\": [\n+         {\n+            \"name\": \"heartbeat.australis.1\",\n+            \"actions\": [\n+               {\n+                  \"name\": \"show_survey\",\n+                  \"impl_hash\": \"4011cf569f3639b9069fc2c50117d3f8597e83c61be2014081ad06ee0fe427c2\",\n+                  \"arguments\": {", "body_text": "Oh.
