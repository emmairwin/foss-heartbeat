To do this, we need\n+a way to instruct Firefox to perform certain actions without having to download\n+an update or wait for a new release.\n+\n+To accomplish this goal, the SHIELD system consists of:\n+\n+Normandy\n+   Service that acts as the source of actions that we wish to perform, and\n+   determines which users receive which recipes.\n+Self-Repair System Addon\n+   Ships with Firefox and handles fetching recipes and action implementations\n+   from Normandy and executing them within Firefox.\n+\n+.. note:: Normandy provides both the names of actions and, separately,\n+   implmentations for them to be used in the self-repair system addon.
