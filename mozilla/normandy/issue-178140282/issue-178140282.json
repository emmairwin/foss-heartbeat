By now we've built a lot of confidence in running on HTTPS and haven't seen any problems from it.

Since we redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS anyways, this is what we want. The risk is that if we decide that we want to stop all HTTPS for some reason, it would take up to 6 months for clients to stop trying to use HTTPS.
