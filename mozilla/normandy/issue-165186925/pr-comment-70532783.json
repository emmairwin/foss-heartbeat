They're executed locally in the client's browser and, if they\n+pass, the corresponding recipe is executed. Filter expressions have access to\n+information about the user, such as their location, locale, and Firefox version.\n+\n+Filter expressions are written using a language called JEXL_. JEXL is an\n+open-source expression language that is given a context (in this case,\n+information about the user's browser) and evaluates a statement using that\n+context. JEXL stands for \"JavaScript Expression Language\" and uses JavaScript\n+syntax for several (but not all) of its features.\n+\n+.. note:: The rest of this document includes examples of JEXL syntax that has\n+   comments inline with the expressions. JEXL does **not** have any support for\n+   comments in statements, but we're using them to make understanding our\n+   examples easier.\n+\n+.. _JEXL: https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/Jexl\n+\n+JEXL Basics\n+-----------\n+The `JEXL Readme`_ describes the syntax of the language in detail; the following\n+section covers the basics of writing valid JEXL expressions.\n+\n+.. note:: Normally, JEXL doesn't allow newlines or other whitespace besides\n+   spaces in expressions, but filter expressions in Normandy allow arbitrary\n+   whitespace.\n+\n+A JEXL expression evaluates down to a single value. JEXL supports several basic\n+types, such as numbers, strings (single or double quoted), and booleans. JEXL\n+also supports several operators for combining values, such as arithmetic,\n+boolean operators, comparisons, and string concatenation.\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   // Arithmetic\n+   2 + 2 - 3 // == 1\n+\n+   // Numerical comparisons\n+   5 > 7 // == false\n+\n+   // Boolean operators\n+   false || 5 > 4 // == true\n+\n+   // String concatenation\n+   \"Mozilla\" + \" \" + \"Firefox\" // == \"Mozilla Firefox\"\n+\n+Expressions can be grouped using parenthesis:\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   ((2 + 3) * 3) - 3 // == 7\n+\n+JEXL also supports lists and objects (known as dictionaries in other languages)\n+as well as attribute access:\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   [1, 2, 1].length // == 3\n+   {foo: 1, bar: 2}.foo // == 1\n+\n+Unlike JavaScript, JEXL supports an ``in`` operator for checking if a substring\n+is in a string or if an element is in an array:\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   \"bar\" in \"foobarbaz\" // == true\n+   3 in [1, 2, 3, 4] // == true\n+\n+The context passed to JEXL can be expressed using identifiers, which also\n+support attribute access:\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   normandy.locale == 'en-US' // == true if the client's locale is en-US\n+\n+Another unique feature of JEXL is transforms, which modify the value given to\n+them. Transforms are applied to a value using the ``|`` operator, and may take\n+additional arguments passed in the expression:\n+\n+.. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+   'January 7th, 1980'|date // == a date object\n+\n+.. _JEXL Readme: https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/Jexl#jexl---\n+\n+Context\n+-------\n+This section defines the context passed to filter expressions when they are\n+evaluated. In other words, this is the client information available within\n+filter expressions.\n+\n+.. js:data:: normandy\n+\n+   The ``normandy`` object contains general information about the client.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.version\n+\n+   **Example:** ``'47.0.1'``\n+\n+   String containing the user's Firefox version.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.channel\n+\n+   String containing the update channel. Valid values include, but are not\n+   limited to:\n+\n+   * ``'release'``\n+   * ``'aurora'``\n+   * ``'beta'``\n+   * ``'nightly'``\n+   * ``'default'`` (self-built or automated testing builds)\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.isDefaultBrowser\n+\n+   Boolean specifying whether Firefox is set as the user's default browser.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.searchEngine\n+\n+   **Example:** ``'google'``\n+\n+   String containing the user's default search engine identifier.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.syncSetup\n+\n+   Boolean containing whether the user has set up Firefox Sync.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.plugins\n+\n+   An object mapping of plugin names to :js:class:`Plugin` objects describing\n+   the plugins installed on the client.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.locale\n+\n+   **Example:** ``'en-US'``\n+\n+   String containing the user's locale.\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.country\n+\n+   **Example:** ``'US'``\n+\n+   `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2`_ country code for the country that the user is located\n+   in. This is determined via IP-based geolocation.\n+\n+   .. _ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1\n+\n+.. js:attribute:: normandy.request_time\n+\n+   Date object set to the time and date that the user requested recipes from\n+   Normandy. Useful for comparing against date ranges that a recipe is valid\n+   for.\n+\n+   .. code-block:: javascript\n+\n+      // Do not run recipe after January 1st.\n+      normandy.request_time < '2011-01-01'|date\n+\n+Transforms\n+----------\n+This section describes the transforms available to filter expressions, and what\n+they do. They're documented as functions, and the first parameter to each\n+function is the value being transformed.\n+\n+.. js:function:: date(dateString)\n+\n+   Parses a string as a date and returns a Date object.
