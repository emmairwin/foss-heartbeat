They're executed locally in the client's browser and, if they\n+pass, the corresponding recipe is executed. Filter expressions have access to\n+information about the user, such as their location, locale, and Firefox version.\n+\n+Filter expressions are written using a language called JEXL_. JEXL is an\n+open-source expression language that is given a context (in this case,\n+information about the user's browser) and evaluates a statement using that\n+context. JEXL stands for \"JavaScript Expression Language\" and uses JavaScript\n+syntax for several (but not all) of its features.\n+\n+.. note:: The rest of this document includes examples of JEXL syntax that has\n+   comments inline with the expressions. JEXL does **not** have any support for\n+   comments in statements, but we're using them to make understanding our\n+   examples easier.", "body_text": "This sounds like a good patch to submit to JEXL.", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/normandy/pulls/194", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/normandy/pulls/comments/70532033", "created_at": "2016-07-12T22:11:59Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "This sounds like a good patch to submit to JEXL.\n", "updated_at": "2016-07-14T17:17:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla/normandy/pull/194#discussion_r70532033", "pull_request_review_id": null, "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/normandy/pulls/comments/70532033"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/mozilla/normandy/pull/194#discussion_r70532033"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/normandy/pulls/194"}}, "commit_id": "f92a4dbaad17aac0e7436f11f659b847aba54fe6", "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mythmon", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/305049?v=4", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/received_events", "gravatar_id": "", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "site_admin": false, "login": "mythmon", "type": "User", "id": 305049, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mythmon/followers"}, "position": 17, "path": "docs/user/filter_expressions.rst", "body_html": "<p>This sounds like a good patch to submit to JEXL.</p>", "original_commit_id": "51844a10a9a09fa24aeb8744d49cce13594d6990", "id": 70532033}
