This is not suitable for development.\n+\n+Prerequisites\n+-------------\n+This guide assumes you have already installed and set up the following:\n+\n+1. Docker_\n+2. `Postgres 9.4`_\n+\n+.. _Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\n+.. _Postgres 9.4: http://www.postgresql.org/\n+\n+Preparing an environment file\n+-----------------------------\n+Normandy gets all of its configuration via environment variables. Docker\n+has built in support for this pattern. For this set up, we will be using\n+and environment file to specifiy this configuration, and having Docker\n+read that file.\n+\n+The file can be named anything, but canonically is named ``.env``. The\n+only thing that is required is a database config, which looks something\n+like the below. We'll go over how to fill in the blanks next.\n+\n+.. code-block:: ini\n+\n+  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<db_name>\n+\n+``<username>`` and ``<password>`` are the details to authenticate with\n+Postgres. ``<db_name>`` is the name of the database to connect to, and\n+is usually ``normandy``.\n+\n+``<host>`` is more complicated. This needs to be something that the\n+Docker container can use to connect to Postgres. There are a few options here:\n+\n+Linux with local Postgres\n+  Use ``172.17.0.1``\n+\n+_`Docker Toolbox` with local Postgres (OSX or Windows)\n+  Use ``192.168.99.1``\n+\n+.. _the Docker Toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/\n+\n+Configuring Postgres\n+--------------------\n+\n+1. Listening on the Docker IP:\n+\n+  By default Postgres only listens on localhost, and so Docker containers\n+  won't be able to connect to it. To change this, edit your Postgres config\n+  (it is in the Postgres data directory, often at\n+  ``/var/lib/postgres/postgresql.conf`` or similar). There should be a commented\n+  out line like:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: ini\n+\n+    #listen_addresses = 'localhost'\n+\n+  Uncomment it, and change it to include the host IP address you found above,\n+  like:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: ini\n+\n+    listen_addresses = 'localhost,172.17.0.1'\n+\n+2. Allowing connections from the Docker subnet:\n+\n+   Postgres has ACLs per IP, so we'll need to allow connections from the Docker\n+   network. Edit your Postgres HBA file, ``pg_hba.conf``. It should be in the\n+   same place as ``postgresql.conf``. Add a line referencing the docker\n+   network, like this:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: ini\n+\n+     host    all             all             172.17.0.0/16           trust\n+\n+   For Docker Toolbox, use ``192.168.99.0/24``.\n+\n+Running Normandy", "body_text": "We could probably write that script.
