Git_\n+2. `Python 3.5`_, `pip 8`_ or higher, and virtualenv_\n+3. `Postgres 9.4`_\n+4. ``openssl``\n+\n+These docs assume a Unix-like operating system, although the site should, in\n+theory, run on Windows as well. All the example commands given below are\n+intended to be run in a terminal.\n+\n+.. _Git: https://git-scm.com/\n+.. _Python 2.7: https://www.python.org/\n+.. _pip 8: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/\n+.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/\n+.. _Postgres 9.4: http://www.postgresql.org/\n+\n+Installation\n+------------\n+1. Clone this repository or your fork_:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: bash\n+\n+      git clone --recursive https://github.com/mozilla/normandy.git\n+      cd normandy\n+\n+2. Create a virtualenv for Normandy and activate it:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: bash\n+\n+      virtualenv venv\n+      source ./venv/bin/activate\n+\n+   .. note::\n+\n+      Whenever you want to work on Normandy in a new terminal you'll have to\n+      re-activate the virtualenv. Read the virtualenv_ documentation to learn\n+      more about how virtualenv works.\n+\n+3. Install the dependencies using pip:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: bash\n+\n+      pip install -r requirements.txt\n+\n+   .. note::\n+\n+      If you get an error like `pip: error: no such option: --hash`, you are\n+      using too old a version of Pip. Please upgrade to Pip 8 or above.\n+\n+      If you get an error like this, the solution is harder::\n+\n+         THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE. If you have\n+         updated the package versions, please update the hashes. Otherwise, examine the\n+         package contents carefully; someone may have tampered with them.\n+            alabaster==0.7.7 from https://pypi.python.org/packages/py2.py3/a/alabaster/alabaster-0.7.7-py2.py3-none-any.whl\n+                Expected sha256 d57602b3d730c2ecb978a213face0b7a16ceaa4a263575361bd4fd9e2669a544\n+                      Got        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n+\n+      Normandy pins requirements with both a package version, and also a package\n+      hash. This gives reproducibility in builds. If you are sure that there is\n+      a good reason for your packages to have a different hash, add another hash\n+      line to requirements.txt for the requirement in question, like this::\n+\n+         alabaster==0.7.7 \\\n+            --hash d57602b3d730c2ecb978a213face0b7a16ceaa4a263575361bd4fd9e2669a544 \\\n+            --hash xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n+\n+      A good reason for the hash to be different is if you use a platform that\n+      isn't covered by the existing hashes for a package that has wheels.\n+\n+\n+4. Create a Postgres database for Normandy. By default it is assumed to be named\n+   ``normandy``:\n+\n+   .. code-block:: bash\n+\n+      createdb normandy\n+\n+   .. note::\n+\n+      If you use a different name for the database, or otherwise want to\n+      customize how you connect to the database, you may specify the database\n+      URL by adding the following to a ``.env`` file at the root of the repo:\n+\n+      .. code-block:: ini\n+\n+         DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@server_addr/database_name", "body_text": "Oh sorry.
