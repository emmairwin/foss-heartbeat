In the [main view](https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/stores_l10n/), completion cell turns green when localization is complete.\n+* Release Engineering to get translations through [API](https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/stores_l10n/documentation/). This is currently happening only for Android, via [mozapkpublisher](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/mozapkpublisher/), but there are plans to extend it to App Store content.\n+* Other users, for example designers working on screenshots, to copy and paste translation without accessing directly repositories.\n+\n+Refer to the [README](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/#installation) in the code repository for instructions on how to install this app.\n+\n+# Projects configuration\n+The entire configuration is stored inside the [Project class](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/blob/master/app/classes/Stores/Project.php).\n+\n+`$products_data` stores all supported products, with the following structure for each of them:\n+```PHP\n+'fx_android' =>\n+    [\n+        'channels' => ['beta', 'release'],\n+        'name'     => 'Firefox for Android',\n+        'store'    => 'google',\n+    ],\n+```\n+\n+Relevant information in this array:\n+* The ID of the project, used also for API calls, it\u2019s the item\u2019s key.\n+* Supported channels.\n+* Full name of the product, used in views and navigation.\n+* In which store the project lives. Currently it can be `apple` or `google`.\n+\n+`$supported_locales` includes information on all locales supported for each product and channel. It\u2019s important to note that these lists are used in [Langchecker](/tools/webdashboards/langchecker.md), to determine which locales should see specific files (product pages on mozilla.org, store content).\n+\n+`$locales_mapping` includes information on mappings between Mozilla\u2019s locale codes, and each store\u2019s internal codes.\n+\n+`$templates` determines, for each product and channel, which template is used, and which .lang files are associated to a specific part of the template (What\u2019s new, main listing, screenshots). This array is updated every time there is a [new release](/products/appstores/README.md).\n+\n+In order to add a brand new project, you would need to:\n+* Define the new project and supported channels in `$products_data`.\n+* Define the list of supported locales for each channel in `$supported_locales`.\n+* Define an entry in `$templates`.\n+* Create files in [/templates](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/tree/master/app/templates) and [/view](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/tree/master/app/views) for each supported channel.\n+* Track the new .lang files in Langchecker for the appstores repository.\n+\n+# Template and View Structure\n+This is a portion of the template file used for Focus for iOS.\n+\n+```PHP\n+$screenshots = function ($translations) use ($_) {\n+    return <<<OUT\n+{$_('Automatically block ads<br>& other Web trackers')}\n+\n+{$_('Browse Faster<br>Web pages may load faster<br>by removing trackers')}\n+\n+{$_('Before')}\n+\n+{$_('After')}\n+\n+{$_('Tracker')}\n+\n+{$_('From Mozilla<br>A brand you trust')}\n+OUT;\n+};\n+```\n+\n+Similarly to a Django template, each string is wrapped in a translation function `$_('')` (defined in [app/inc/utilities.php](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/blob/master/app/inc/utilities.php#L5)).\n+Strings are grouped into a variable, like `$screenshots` in this case: this allows, for example, to determine the overall length of all strings included in a section, to see if it exceeds the [limits imposed by stores](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/stores_l10n/blob/master/app/inc/constants.php#L15-L22).", "path": "tools/stores_l10n/README.md", "position": null, "original_position": 72, "commit_id": "624e2117d340d70caf33194bc7fb29eee6be6b4e", "original_commit_id": "197ebd4b10ef9e3e426c852c003edb20fc6bdfc3", "user": {"login": "flodolo", "id": 3644868, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644868?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/flodolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Good point.
