This helps reduce the chance of breaking the builds in the future, once your locale is actually shipping, and generally helps catch errors earlier on. It also gives you an overview of your locale's health and status.\n+\n+When you are in your dashboard, and you notice that there is a red tick in your locale's \"Action\" column, this means there is a critical error that you need to fix. Clicking on your locale's \"Status\" column will give you an indication on what needs to be fixed, and where to find the error.", "path": "products/firefox_android/localize_android.md", "position": null, "original_position": 17, "commit_id": "e2169c6f3192fed9ec068a24bd774432d5fda0db", "original_commit_id": "71130276b75bf8aeca844fdd7ccb0f65013674c0", "user": {"login": "Delphine", "id": 399020, "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/399020?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine", "html_url": "https://github.com/Delphine", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Delphine/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "OK waiting to hear back on comment above for this.\r\nConcerning focusing on errors and warning alone: I have a feeling I'm already doing that.
