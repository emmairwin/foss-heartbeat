Merge day is the date that you have to finish all your localization work by, in order to get it up on builds.\n+\n+You can see the [detailed schedule for each release here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar).\n+\n+Note: please make sure that you've already localized mozilla.org before you start working on Firefox for Android or any other projects.\n+\n+## Localize the Firefox for Android folder\n+- [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/firefox-for-android-aurora/): Choose your locale code from there\n+- [Pootle](https://mozilla.locamotion.org/projects/mobile/ ): Choose your locale code from there\n+\n+Once you've finished covering this folder, please note you still have strings to translate. See below for more instructions.\n+\n+## Localize the shared Firefox strings\n+\n+In order to reach 100% completion on the Firefox for Android l10n project, you will have to localize the shared Firefox files (so, the ones common to Firefox Desktop and Android) as well. These are found in the Firefox Aurora folder:\n+- [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/firefox-aurora/): Choose your locale code from there. Localize all file paths that start with dom, netwerk, security, services and toolkit\n+- [Pootle](https://mozilla.locamotion.org/projects/firefox/): Choose your locale code from there. In the list you now see, localize the files found in \"androidshared\" folder.\n+\n+Once you've reached 100% completion for the shared strings: let the Fennec project manager know (currently delphine at mozilla dot com). A bug will be filed to add your locale to the single-locale builds.\n+\n+These builds are available here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora-android-api-15-l10n/.\n+This means that you will be able to download a build on your Android device to test your locale. Please note that at this point, your locale still isn't shipping on official Firefox for Android builds. That will come later.\n+\n+## Considerations for brand new locales that have no Desktop version yet\n+If you have not already launched Firefox Desktop in your language, then you are probably missing some important pieces, such as a search engine.\n+\n+Bugs will need to be filed, which can be done by following filing out the form here: https://l10n.mozilla.org/bugs/new-locale", "path": "products/firefox_android/localize_android.md", "position": null, "original_position": 29, "commit_id": "e2169c6f3192fed9ec068a24bd774432d5fda0db", "original_commit_id": "8d25bfb2293712e525acabc08619033bc325577f", "user": {"login": "flodolo", "id": 3644868, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644868?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/flodolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "I would specify that this is done by l10n-drivers, not localizers?", "created_at": "2017-02-14T08:56:26Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-18T03:13:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/48#discussion_r100984108", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/48", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/comments/100984108"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/48#discussion_r100984108"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/48"}}, "body_html": "<p>I would specify that this is done by l10n-drivers, not localizers?</p>", "body_text": "I would specify that this is done by l10n-drivers, not localizers?"}
