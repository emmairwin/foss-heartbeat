This is the moment to engage as much people as possible: have them use and check-out these builds regularly. The more eyes on them, the better.\n+\n+First, authorize 3rd party app downloads first from your Android phone's settings. From your phone, download your locale from https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-aurora-android-api-15-l10n/ by clicking on the most recent link with your locale code in it (Note: you may want to scroll down the page to make sure you are choosing the most recent build!)\n+\n+Then, choose the .apk link out of the 3 possible options listed. Download should start and once the app is installed, you should be able to test your locale.\n+\n+### What to look out for?\n+- Language quality\n+- Truncated words (cut-off from screen)\n+- Anything that appears broken on the UI\n+- Check out at all the main screens, UI, menus, tabs, new features, etc. Make sure these all look good, that everything is properly translated and appears as expected\n+- Font support\n+- Check that all searchplugins are working correctly\n+\n+\n+It is strongly suggested to start using these builds on a daily basis, so that you can get into as many screens as possible and check that everything looks fine.\n+\n+It is important that the people testing the localization be not only the one(s) who have localized. Ask other people from your community to help test so we have fresh eyes looking at your work.\n+\n+## Testing on multi-locale builds (shipping in Play Store)\n+\n+Once the Fennec Project Manager (currently delphine at mozilla dot com) sees that you've done at least one cycle on a single-locale build, that nothing breaks when we do sign-offs, that you've continued keeping your work up to date, and that you have been TESTING it - we will consider putting adding your language to the multi-locale builds. This means that - congratulations! - your locale will now officially be shipping on Firefox for Android.\n+\n+Once we add your locale to the multi-locale builds, it will \"ride the trains\" like for Firefox Desktop. It will first ship on Aurora in the Play Store, then 6 weeks later it will ship on Beta, and 6 will after that, it will arrive on Release.\n+\n+Once you start shipping in the Play Store, it makes sense to stop testing on single-locale builds. We suggest you now start testing and using the Aurora Play Store version, since this is the branch that you localize and work on.  It's good to have other members in the community use the beta and release version too though, in case anything breaks with updates.\n+\n+When testing the multi-locale build, keep in mind and look out for the same things called out for the single-locale builds in the section above.\n+\n+We send out regular reminders about merge days, android updates, schedule and important info on dev.l10n mailing list (https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n ). Please make sure you're following this so you get regular updates about which part of the cycle you're at, when you need to finish your work, and anything relevant to what you are doing.", "path": "products/firefox_android/testing_android.md", "position": null, "original_position": 34, "commit_id": "e2169c6f3192fed9ec068a24bd774432d5fda0db", "original_commit_id": "8d25bfb2293712e525acabc08619033bc325577f", "user": {"login": "flodolo", "id": 3644868, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644868?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/flodolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "nit: Android\r\nput the link on the text instead of between parentheses", "created_at": "2017-02-14T09:04:25Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-18T03:13:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/48#discussion_r100985560", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/48", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/comments/100985560"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/48#discussion_r100985560"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/48"}}, "body_html": "<p>nit: Android<br>\nput the link on the text instead of between parentheses</p>", "body_text": "nit: Android\nput the link on the text instead of between parentheses"}
