Currenty, thanks to cross-channel, we ship all versions of Firefox from a [single localization repository](https://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/), but sign-offs only happen for the Beta channel:\n+* Nightly builds always use the tip of the repository, i.e. the latest changes available.\n+* Beta builds only use the signed off version.\n+* Release builds uses the latest signed off version from Beta, and can\u2019t normally be updated to use a most recent version.\n+\n+Sign-offs are tied to a specific app version. For example, Firefox 57 starts in Nightly and doesn\u2019t get any sign-off; it then moves to Beta and get multiple sign-offs as the localization progresses. It then moves to release, and any dot release (e.g. 57.0.1) will use the latest sign-off available for the 57 version, done when it was still in Beta.\n+\n+Note that sign-offs on Beta are not possible through the entire cycle: sign-offs deadline is normally on Wednesday, about 2 weeks before the release, to allow time for at least one more Beta build before the end of the cycle.\n+\n+Beta sign-offs are performed on l10n.mozilla.org (elmo) [in this page](https://l10n.mozilla.org/shipping/dashboard?tree=fennec_beta&tree=fx_beta).\n+\n+## How to perform sign-offs\n+\n+[This page](https://l10n.mozilla.org/shipping/dashboard?tree=fennec_beta&tree=fx_beta) only includes sign-offs for Firefox desktop (`fx_beta`) and Firefox for Android (`fennec_beta`) beta.\n+\n+![Sign-offs table repository](/assets/images/signoffs/signoffs_table.png)\n+\n+A green checkmark is displayed in the *Status* column if the locale has a sign-off, while it\u2019s empty if there are no sign-offs for this locale. This typically happens for brand new locales that are only shipping in Nightly.\n+\n+The *Action* column can display several icons:\n+* A prohibited icon indicates that there is no activity after the last sign-off (belonging to a previous version), and therefore it\u2019s not possible to do an updated sign-off.\n+* A sparkline icon indicates activity that should be checked:\n+    * Green indicates that the translation is complete (no error, no missing strings).\n+    * Orange means that the product is still incomplete.\n+    * Red means that there are errors in the localization. The number of errors and warnings is also reported within the table.\n+\n+To perform the sign-off, click on the sparkline icon. It will open a new page, showing information about the last sign-off, and the changesets that follows it.\n+\n+![List of changesets](/assets/images/signoffs/changesets_table.png)\n+\n+For each changeset, it\u2019s possible to check `compare-locale`\u2019s results by clicking on the link in the second column from the left. Errors and warnings would be reported in the link too.\n+\n+Some changesets won\u2019t have a link to `compare-locales`\u2019s results (e.g. the second row in the image above). That indicates a changeset that doesn\u2019t affect the product you\u2019re currently signing off (e.g. a Thunderbird change in Firefox), and it\u2019s not a good candidate for sign-offs.\n+\n+By clicking the top gray circle on the rightmost column, you can display a diff between the latest changeset and the most recent sign-off. Note that both circles can be dragged, to display the diff between specific changesets. It\u2019s also possible to load more changeset at the bottom of the table using the *Load more* button.", "path": "products/review/signoffs.md", "position": null, "original_position": 39, "commit_id": "e317820fea15def96f36014c4fb89f40a120fc12", "original_commit_id": "dedf3df21e451cca89a1a1bd68ee00ec79034a5f", "user": {"login": "Pike", "id": 43494, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/43494?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike", "html_url": "https://github.com/Pike", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Pike/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Actually, all of the column can be clicked to open the diff view.
