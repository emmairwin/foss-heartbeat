If we point them to the team's page, you need to update this paragraph and the following.

I would ask them to focus on errors and warnings alone.

Do you mean I should change the link to the dashboard to the teams page? Or add the teams page (and the fact they can bookmark their own) as additional information?
.

Fixed stuff again :)  Let me know now! thanks.

nit: Android
put the link on the text instead of between parentheses.

I think you should point to /products/firefox_android/setup_searchplugins.md for now. We'll update it when the new shared document is available.

Uhm - I was looking at the wrong README. Will update, I understand why this wasn't making sense to me. .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/comment-280827546.json . 
I think everything looks good. We can always fix minor stuff later (I'll do a direct pass on the single quotes).

For reference: URL.

Straight quote -> apostrophe, no double spaces, use * instead of - for lists. There was already a lot going on here and didn't want to bother you with nits :-)

.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-100983603.json . 
Nit: it's not 6 weeks anymore, it's variable (6-8 weeks).
Also: merge day is when localizations move to the next train, and the last day available to include localization updates to the next Beta version if you work on tools like Pootle.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-101828909.json . 
If it makes things easier, you could point to a specific locale's team page, explaining that you can replace the locale code in the URL or search for your team in the /teams page. I think the latter would be enough.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-101457264.json . 
I'd move this sentence right after the 8 weeks one.

Thanks!
Concerning the readme: I didn't change it because looking at it now, I don't really see where that would fit.
It already links to the Android and Firefox folders in the 1st bullet point, and then you list out what they contain. I would need to probably reformat all this it want to add direct links to these docs.
Should I just do that? .
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-101828927.json . 
OK waiting to hear back on comment above for this.
Concerning focusing on errors and warning alone: I have a feeling I'm already doing that. Do you think I'm giving too much information and should strip that down? Or were you thinking of something else?
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-101829911.json . 
Actually, warnings are not even displayed on that page (didn't remember that :-\)
URL.

I meant that they should not be focusing on orange or green icon, only on the number of errors and warnings (in /shipping). On the team's page, only on error notices and finding them in the linked page.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-100985375.json . 
Only one space after periods.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-100983830.json . 
General nit, feel free to ignore it: the rest of the documentation uses ’ (apostrophe) instead of a straight quote. Nothing bad if you keep it like this, just better consistency if you update it.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-207407938/pr-comment-101456862.json . 
I have the feeling you misread my comment (or it wasn't clear): I was asking you to add a link to these 2 documents in the README, not to link the README from these docs.

Let's remove the "in the same way…"?
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-292635964/comment-361554682.json . 


Right now it doesn't have a practical effect, but it's correct as it is right now: you add the file to maemo-locales and remove it from the excluded list at the same time, since these two operations have the same goal (add locale to multi-locales build).

For both, you need a sign-off on Beta before it goes to build.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-292635964/pr-comment-164851203.json . 
Yeah it's a "heavy" sentence, agreed we can drop that.
.
#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-292635964/comment-361467429.json . 
Hmm on second thoughts, I'm thinking I'm not explaining things correctly in the multi-locale doc.
Is it that you only remove it from the "exclude-multi-locale" section once you've added the locale to multi-locales and done a sign-off so that it is now on Beta? I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to work, not having done it before :/ thanks for helping clarify that part!

That would be great, not sure if someone has cycles to work on it. Also, it's not like we're adding a lot of locales, it would be a pretty low priority.

I updated this based on the desktop version, so there may be some things I missed mentioning since I've never used the toml file before.
Also, seems like you only touch the toml file for all-locales and not for maemo - but let me know if I got that wrong and I can update the docs accordingly. thanks!

@adngdb , apologize for taking this long to review the doc. Finally I have a real project so I can give it an official run. The instruction is clear and I can follow through the steps and the output is what I expected.

I do have some questions for you to see if you have tips or advice on how to process the project in as little time as possible. After I tried the process on staging, all looked good. When I switch to production side, I have to front load the strings, select the languages, and save the project. Only after this step, when the project technically has gone public, that I can "manage strings" - add comments, check that the strings are all in the right place and in the correct sequence. 

What I am afraid is that as soon as the strings go public, localizers start to translate right away. Are there workarounds to either shorten my prep time or disable the project until I am ready to publish it (Save Project):.

A: Can I Save Project and Disable it at the same time so I can "Manage strings"? Once done, uncheck Disabled box? 
B: Alternatively, if there is a way to upload the file I prepared at staging to production (since I have checked it there already) to reduce the time needed prepping on production? 

Thank you!

@peiying2 You can indeed disable the project, save it, make all your changes and the de-disable it to make it available to localizers. I'm afraid at the moment there's no better solution for you. We talked about having a better form of import at a second step to this, but we wanted to make sure that the feature was useful first. Now that you're using it, how about we take some time to work on the various improvements you'd like to see? Maybe setup a meeting next week? 

For the moment, I see two features: add comments to the export document, and allow importing that same document (so that you can setup on stage, then just have to export / import to prod). .

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267/comment-364283134.json . 
@adngdb, I have added more strings to the existing project. Initially I added to the production side directly but on the status bar, it shows 100% completion, so I clicked on the link, at file level, it does show the strings waiting to be completed, but between the % icon and the status bar, a localizer won't know something new is added to an existing project at higher level. I went to the staging site to add these strings, it didn't fix the problem. The Sync button is for repo type of project, not database type, but I tried it too, :). It didn't work. We need to have the status feature fixed. .

For this email project, since we are covering all the email languages, I will set it up the standard way. 

Is there a way to preserve the comment in the output file? URL This has a lot of comments. Alternatively, I can copy the translated strings to the original file from the requester.

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-276022267/comment-360949596.json . 
@adngdb this is the first: URL Given most of the requests come from marketing, can we have a high level project name, and sub-category (check Engagement project for reference). Otherwise, all the requests have a very flat structure, and may flood a locale dashboard very quickly. All the individual file name will be called "database". This is only a "wish". If this means spending a lot of your time to improve the feature, then don't do it. Thanks!

Are these shipping locales, or enabled locales? Or am I completely lost and those are the locales supported by the store? We are referring to shipping locales later in the doc. I know some time ago we had two separate lists, one for the shipping locales, one for the enabled locales, I assume this is still the case. Not sure if it’s worth mentioning that the list need to be maintained, or if it’s something obvious enough (or already mentioned many times in this doc)

Recap of IRC discussion with Delphine. 

If you use Atom, you can install a package called smart-quotes-plus (go into Preferences, select Install on the left, search for the name and install it).

Then use ctrl+alt+' to swap all quotes to the correct ones (you can do it also on a selection of text). Make sure that you don't do that on a document that contain ' (e.g. code fragments). If you don't remember the shortcut, you can press alt+shift+p and search for smartquotes.

Not sure if we want something in the docs about this.

So the trouble is actually not in the inline-code tag, but in the code that's inside the code block, because Jekyll tried to process it after the deploy to inline-code? In that case adding inline-code should disable it. As we do not use Jekyll, we may want to disable it for all repos so the problem won't reappear in the future.

From what I understand, the "mirror" effect is not exactly 100% flip over horizontally.

We need to simplify this, e.g.

change it to be more specific: "... or they will be redirected to en-US if the pages are not." If this is still wrong or confusing, we need to change the sentence. The point is that they should check the links. .

No double spaces after period, one empty line after is enough.

Again, localizers are not supposed to know that the UX team wants or decides.

the production -> production, or the production server
webpage dashboard -> web dashboard

I don't think we should explain tags to them, they don't see them. We should just tell them that new strings added to existing pages are visible in production only when localized, unless they're in a shared file.

For the last part, the concept is that sometimes a completely new template is used for a page, e.g. the home page, and that deadlines are strict: after the deadline, the old template will be disabled. All these big changes are communicated well in advance on the mailing list.

Links might external to mozilla.org, on websites that are en-US only. It's a bit hard given how many possibilities there are.

Even if they are on mozilla.org, it might be pages that we don't localize. 

Personally I would drop both sentences, maybe only add a note about testing the links to verify that the translation of the link is coherent and the link is functional.

* Plan: refers to schedule that includes milestones
* Expectation: how the files are delivered, all at once or incrementally, in what file format (especially video/audio) etc. Or when localized work is delivered, what else does the vendor need to do, does mozilla provide test plan if they need to test, etc.

@gueroJeff, @Delphine, @TheoChevalier, at the moment, i am stuck with this doc not making any progress.  If it is ok as it stands, knowing we can update at a later time with new and different info, can we go with this doc.  Only @flodolo provided feedback. He has specifically highlighted the areas that lack reasons for certain tasks. Do you feel the same?  

Given the new dimension of working with agency, such as marketing agency, I will need to add a new section for that, if this interests anyone other than me, :).  This new process may be duplicated in Asia in the coming months.  .

Theo, let's merge it and add changes later.

I reread the CASA process, it is not far from what we stated here, I just need to blend some of the content in the MSA (legal review) and PO part (finance review) text we have with links.

I don't think you need to call this out explicitly. If they add/remove new strings, they will be added/removed properly. If they modify them, they will be updated.

Nice work!

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-247363005/pr-comment-130860410.json . 
I wonder what happens if you rename a file and change strings too. Will Pontoon ignore those changes in the next Sync?

#mozilla-l10n/documentation/issue-247363005/pr-133688668.json . 
@mathjazz Not sure about the part inline-code, but I assume it’s safer not to touch content in addition to renaming the file.

block-code.

This is not correct: if you rename a file completely localized for locale X in the repository, Pontoon will read it, expose it as completely translated as it was before. What you're losing is history, attribution, pending suggestions.

This is mostly for internal use (and curious folks). I'm afraid that putting that information without explaining first how diff view works, how to reach it, etc. might become really hard. Not sure if a reminder at the beginning would be enough.

Do you want to add your general feedback before I try to change this doc a bit, for example removing the comparison with a localization repository?

Per vidyo chat: I'm going to merge this, then we can iterate over it going forward.

Thanks Delphine, I'll wait for Pike's review this week. We might end up changing it quite a bit, since this describes my way of testing the strings, but I'm afraid it's far from being the best for everyone.

This definitely needs review from a different pair of eyes (see #34)

Fixed by #39.

Document needs to include:.
* Instructions on the packages to install and setup in a Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)
* Probably a bash script to take care of the setup for you

Thanks for checking. Given that now you need to go through mozilla-central, I doubt we'll have localizers doing it. It will be an exception, and sending them to the other doc should be enough.

The best way to check this is to take a quick look at the diff, then browse the documentation starting from here

Got this! I wanna chat with you in Austin to make sure I get it all :) I think it's mostly clear, but just in case. .

See URL.

We need to update the documentation:.
* When adding a new locale, it needs to be added to exclude-multi-locale
* When moving it to beta, it needs to be removed from that list.

This totally slipped on my radar. Putting it back up there :)

Updated with minimal info. Could add more details later if needed.

@Delphine 
I've made a few changes, also to fix checks failing. Can you take a look?

Looks good! Thanks for catching that error Flod - couldn't tell if I was supposed to skip a line or not for the 
block-code.

I'm not sure if this is the right place: if you run the script at this point, you will end up with changed files before creating a branch, new files will be potentially added to the appstores repository, etc.

I would put it into a separate section with its own title, e.g. "Updating the list of supported locales".

Another thing to call out: If the script changes the list of locales, it's important to run inline-code to add missing files in appstores.
