Check https://www-dev.allizom.org/en-US/ to confirm\n * Error page: Deliberately type a broken link, such as https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/neu/, check whether [404 page](https://www-dev.allizom.org/404/) is localized\n * If your language is RTL, make sure that the page layout and text flow in the correct directions\n \n-### Compatibility Testing:\n+### Compatibility testing:\n * Test the page layout in other major browsers and on other platforms\n * Test the page layout on the leading locally developed browser if available\n * Test the page layout on mobile devices of major platforms\n \n-## When Can I See the Localized Page on the Production Server?\n+## When can I see the localized page on the production server?\n \n Updated translations are pushed to the production server almost daily.\n \n When a brand new page is available for localization, it won\u2019t be enabled in production until it\u2019s fully localized. When existing pages receive updates with new strings, this new content won\u2019t be displayed on production until localized, to avoid displaying a mix of English and localized text.\n \n In some cases pages receive major updates that require a complete rewrite of the template: if this happens, the old template is kept online only for a short period of time and, when removed, it will cause the URL to redirect users to the English version.\n \n-### Sync and Update Frequencies\n+### Sync and update frequencies\n * Pontoon syncs every 20 minutes to the repository\n * Pootle is imported manually (at least daily); an automated solution and faster sync will be implemented soon\n * Web Dashboard and the Dev server update every 15 minutes\n \n If you work on Pontoon, it is safe to say that it will take less than an hour to see your changes reflected on the dashboard and the dev server.\n \n When a project has a firm deadline to meet, it will be communicated through the [dev-l10n-web mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-l10n-web).
