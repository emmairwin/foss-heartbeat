Additionally, it promotes initiatives and campaigns in time of these events. As a result, new pages are created. New content is added to existing pages. New layout is introduced. The localized versions reach 60% of the Mozilla users globally. It is very important that, not only the main pages are localized, they are thoroughly tested before they are launched on production.  \n+\n+## Key Links\n+* Production: https://www.mozilla.org/(locale)/\n+* Staging: https://www-dev.allizom.org/(locale)/\n+* Repository:  https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/www.mozilla.org/\n+* Pontoon: https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/mozillaorg/\n+* Locamotion: https://mozilla.locamotion.org/projects/mozilla_lang/\n+* Web dashboard: https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/webdashboard/{local code}. Visit this page on a regular basis to check localization progress, pending work, deadline, and errors that were introduced during translation. \n+\n+We highly advise you to ask other community members to conduct peer review not only on Pontoon or Locamotion, but on staging.
