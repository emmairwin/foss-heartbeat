The first thing to do it to add the project to `$products_data`, and you\u2019ll need to determine beforehand:\n+* How many channels are supported.\n+* Code name and displayed name for this product.\n+* If the product needs to support App Store (apple) or Play Store (google).\n+\n+This is the configuration for Focus for Android:\n+\n+```PHP\n+private $products_data = [\n+...\n+    'focus_android' =>\n+        [\n+            'channels' => ['release'],\n+            'name'     => 'Focus for Android',\n+            'store'    => 'google',\n+        ],\n+...\n+];\n+```\n+\n+Then you need to add an entry in `$supported_locales` for each of the channels available. Since Focus for Android only has a release channel, it will be:\n+\n+```PHP\n+private $supported_locales = [\n+...\n+    'focus_android' => [\n+        'release' => [\n+            'ar', 'ast', 'az', 'bn-BD', 'ca', 'cs', 'cy', 'de', 'el', 'eo',\n+            'es-AR', 'es-CL', 'es-ES', 'es-MX', 'fa', 'fr', 'fy-NL', 'he',\n+            'hu', 'hy-AM', 'id', 'it', 'ja', 'kab', 'ko', 'lo', 'nl', 'pl',\n+            'pt-BR', 'ru', 'sk', 'sl', 'sq', 'sv-SE', 'th', 'tr', 'uk',\n+            'zh-CN', 'zh-TW',\n+        ],\n+    ],\n+...\n+];\n+```\n+\n+Note: it the project is tracked on [Webstatus](https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/webstatus/), you can use its [API](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/webstatus/#available-urls) to get the list of all locales available ([example](https://l10n.mozilla-community.org/webstatus/api/?product=focus-android&txt) for Focus for Android).\n+\n+The next step is to add which templates and .lang files will be used for this project. In case of Focus for Android there is:\n+* `template`: PHP file used to display the full information about this product.\n+* `listing`: .lang file containing the strings used in template (description, keywords, etc.).\n+* `screenshots`: .lang file used to localize screenshots. It\u2019s distinct from the main .lang file in order to support only a subset of languages.\n+\n+Since it\u2019s the first launch for Focus for Android, a `whatsnew` entry won\u2019t be needed, but it will be starting from the first update.", "path": "tools/stores_l10n/add_new_product.md", "position": 56, "original_position": 54, "commit_id": "7c964f1625489adefcca1f74b14bd6794040080b", "original_commit_id": "660183463eedcc096a4dae0c0efa9207e6290f54", "user": {"login": "flodolo", "id": 3644868, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644868?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/flodolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Not much code actually: one variable in template and in the view.
