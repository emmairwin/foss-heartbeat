This should have been sent as part of the vetting process, and it can be updated annually. An example of the official [rate sheet](https://drive.google.com/a/mozilla.com/file/d/0B7u_NzvpgGcgTDhoVFBsN3dMc0E/view?usp=sharing) that includes the following but not limited to:\n+  * Word rate for each of the interested locales as in new words, 100% match, fuzzy match for translation, review, proofreading\n+  * Hourly rate: engineering, QA and testing, PM rate.\n+  * Minimum charge for a project and the thresholds by number of words per locale.\n+  * Rush rate.\n+\n+### Do the initial paperwork\n+\n+A series of activities need to happen before an l10n project can start. The first step is doing the paperwork to be able to receive quotes for projects and pay bills for requests.\n+\n+Unless there are changes in the signed document, this step is done once, for the whole organization, and only at the beginning of relationship engagement.\n+\n+* A master service agreement (or MSA) has to be signed between Mozilla and the vendor. The person signing on Mozilla side could be the PM or PM\u2019s manager. This document shows the conditions that the contract is operated in between the service provider and Mozilla. Without this agreement, a service can\u2019t start. Here is an example of [MSA](https://drive.google.com/a/mozilla.com/file/d/0B7u_NzvpgGcgSW5Jend3TlpyRlE/view?usp=sharing).\n+* An Account Payable (or AP) form has to be filled. It contains banking information, billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, or \u201cas soon as\u201d) and payment due terms (within 30 or 45 days); billing email address. Here is an example of [AP form](https://drive.google.com/a/mozilla.com/file/d/0B7u_NzvpgGcgYmN6c0tJc2IwUzA/view?usp=sharing).\n+\n+PO, or Purchase Order, may or may not be necessary in order to get vendor service. Some teams have ongoing need for l10n service and have a budget set aside annually. This is a good reason to have a PO established. For most projects that are one time need, or sporadic, it\u2019s best to go without a PO, and bill to the serviced department as needed.\n+\n+### Set up accounts\n+\n+Depending on the needs and where the source file can be accessed, it\u2019s good to have an account set up for the vendor\u2019s project manager in the following places:\n+\n+* Pontoon: set up a \u201ctranslator\u201d account when there is no community; or a basic \u201ccontributor\u201d account when a community exists so that the vendor provides suggestions and the community review them.\n+* Bugzilla: so that the vendor\u2019s project manager can interact in bugs. Bugzilla will allow us to have a central place to post project details and updates. Communication is generally handled via email with the vendor, but it\u2019s useful to have a bug number to reference to, and the vendor can use the bug to quickly access all the details.\n+* Google Drive: create a shared folder for the vendor to view, review, and translate directly spreadsheets or Google Docs.\n+* GitHub: give commit permission if they need to commit directly in a repository (e.g. [Legal docs](https://github.com/mozilla/legal-docs/))\n+\n+Note: Additional account setup may be needed if the project does not support our localization process (e.g. Wordpress).\n+\n+Once accounts are set up, allow the agency to explore the tools, flows and the product features to familiarize itself before actual work starts. Make sure to provide links to documentation as needed on how to use Pontoon and explain how to perform queries on Transvision. Setting up a meeting to share your screen might be a good idea, and use this opportunity to answer their questions about the project or the tools.\n+\n+## Localizing a project\n+\n+### Planning the request\n+\n+Once outsourcing is a necessity for a project, before reaching out to the l10n agency to make an official request, make sure to check the following:\n+\n+* Required locales.\n+* Scope of work: is the request asking for anything other than translation, review and testing?\n+* Milestones and Deadline: negotiate it so the agency has sufficient time to finish each of the required tasks, and the community has enough time to review and sign off.\n+* Check with communities if they want to fully handle the request, handle only some parts (e.g. initial translation or QA), or can\u2019t work on it at all and let the agency do the work.\n+\n+### Quotation\n+\n+Now that we have all the initial info we need, we are good to go ahead and reach out to the vendor and provide what they need to generate a quote.\n+\n+* Get a quote from the agency by communicating volume, locales, deadline, level of service needed, and type of content.\n+\n+### Setting everything up for the request\n+\n+Now that we got a quote, we need to get it approved, send content to the vendor, and check permission.\n+\n+* Provide quote/estimate to the project requestor for approval.\n+* For all the target locales, make sure both agency and the community have the proper access to the l10n tool or platform where the localizable content is staged and roles properly assigned per agreement.\n+[//]: <> (* Share the scope, the plan, and the expectations to both the agency and the community.)\n+[//]: <> (* Communicate the plan and the finalized schedule with the project stakeholders.)\n+* File a bug to track project progress. It can be a good idea to remind project specifics (repositories, deadline(s), locales\u2026)\n+\n+### Executing the request\n+\n+The initial quote has been approved, roles and permission are set accordingly to the request. We can now execute it, receive translations and deliver them to the project stakeholders.\n+\n+* Share the content with the agency:\n+  * Strings (whether it\u2019s text files, a link to Pontoon, a link to a repository, a spreadsheet, a Google Doc\u2026)\n+  * Locale specific style guides and product specific term list.\n+  * Terminology: Ask them to always refer to [Transvision](https://transvision.mozfr.org/) to check terminology.\n+  * How you want the translations to be delivered \u2014 as a single batch or as each locale is ready.\n+* Confirm with the vendor the following: word count, schedule and cost of the service.\n+* Run testing/QA once you\u2019ve received the translations, either by the community or the vendor, depending on the project agreement.\n+* Communicate with communities for a chance to review and sign off on the project before releasing to the internal customer.\n+\n+### Post mortem\n+\n+After the project is delivered, we need to handle payment with the vendor and feedback with the communnity.", "path": "misc/working_w_l10n_agency.md", "position": null, "original_position": 81, "commit_id": "426cb31062d1a54d1b0bff64d6c124dc2ac47249", "original_commit_id": "b33692a27e5975c79bfa969fd6ab46a931e598cb", "user": {"login": "flodolo", "id": 3644868, "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644868?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo", "html_url": "https://github.com/flodolo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flodolo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Typo: community.", "created_at": "2017-08-01T11:05:32Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-08T17:31:58Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/77#discussion_r130579068", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/77", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/comments/130579068"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pull/77#discussion_r130579068"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla-l10n/documentation/pulls/77"}}, "body_html": "<p>Typo: community.</p>", "body_text": "Typo: community."}
